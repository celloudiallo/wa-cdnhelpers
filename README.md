Windows Azure CDN Helpers
=========================

Project Description
-------------------

This is a project that helps you quickly utilize the Windows Azure CDN from your ASP.NET MVC website. These helpers will work on sites hosted on and off Windows Azure.

These helpers provide you with an easy way to utilize the Windows Azure CDN to increase the performance of your web application. Utilizing these helpers should give you fairly significant decreases in load time of your site and will reduce the overall size of your website. When configuring these tools I would recommend testing your site with [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) or [Google Page Speed](http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/) to determine which improvements are needed to speed up your site. Many of the recommended improvements will be automatic when using these helpers. 

You must have a Windows Azure account to use these tools. You can sign up for a free trial of Windows Azure [here](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/free-trial/).

This project is released for download on nuget.
